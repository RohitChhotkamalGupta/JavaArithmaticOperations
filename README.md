# JavaArithmaticOperations

This is a basic java project showcasing use of java arithmatic operators .
Here operarions are done using 2 operands only.
After running the program a list of operations will apear like
  1. Addition
  2. Subtaction
  3. Multiplication
  4. Division
  5. Modulus
  6. Exit
  
  Enter your choice : 

This list has put in while loop so untill you give 6 as input or some invalid choice it will keep iterating and you don't have to run program manually everytime.
Here you have to give integer value like 1 for addition 2 for subtration.
If you give choice greater than 6 or any sting choice it will show msg "Try Entering valid choice" and exit.
After giving valid choice it will ask you for two number.
You have to give 2 integer numbers only if you try to give input with other datatype it will throw msg enter valid numbers.
If you are giving valid 2 numbers it will perform operation what you had selected earlier.

Thanks..
